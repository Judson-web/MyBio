## üöÄ Getting Started

To run this project locally:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/Judson-web/mybio.git](https://github.com/Judson-web/mybio.git) # Replace with your actual repo URL
    cd mybio
    ```
2.  **Install Netlify CLI (if you don't have it):**
    ```bash
    npm install -g netlify-cli
    ```
3.  **Set up Environment Variables:**
    You need to set up the following environment variables in your Netlify site settings (or locally via a `.env` file if using Netlify CLI for local functions testing):
    * `GEMINI_API_KEY` (from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey))
    * `LASTFM_API_KEY` (from [Last.fm API](https://www.last.fm/api/account/create))
    * `LASTFM_USERNAME` (your Last.fm username)
    
    **Important:** Never commit your API keys directly to your repository!
    For local testing with Netlify CLI, you can create a `.env` file in the root of your project:
    ```
    GEMINI_API_KEY="your_gemini_api_key_here"
    LASTFM_API_KEY="your_lastfm_api_key_here"
    LASTFM_USERNAME="your_lastfm_username_here"
    ```
4.  **Run Locally:**
    Since this is primarily a static site with Netlify Functions, you can serve it with Netlify CLI:
    ```bash
    netlify dev
    ```
    This will start a local development server and proxy your Netlify Functions.

## üí° Usage

Simply open `index.html` in your browser or visit the live Netlify deployment. Interact with the various modals, try out the CLI commands, and explore the generative art lab!
